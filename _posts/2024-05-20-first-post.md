Today was my very first day of my apprenticeship at Clean Coders.

I woke up at 6 am, had breakfast, and practiced some clojure problems on https://4clojure.oxal.org . The team's stand up meeting was at 10am. I logged in, listened to everyone talk about what they had done over the weekend and what they had planned on working on today. I obviously didn’t have much to contribute considering it was my first day. 

Afterwards my mentor Alex stayed behind and showed me how to use a colloborative coding program called Tuple and gave me a few assignments for the day (including creating this blog). After a brief hassle of having to remember how to pair a new SSH key to github, I cloned the Clojure Koans ( http://clojurekoans.com/ ) repository from GitHub I spent the majority of my day working my way through the Clojure Koans problems. As I worked through them I wrote down anything I was confused about or wanted a stronger explanation for so that I could ask Alex later in the day.

Around 2:15 pm Alex sent me a message to see if I was available to meet on Tuple. We met in Tuple and he took the time to explain all of the concepts I had noted being confused about. After we left the chat I took a quick break to visit with my wife before she took off to her second job. I then researched setting up this blog. As of now I am hosting it through GitHub pages with a super simple lay out. If I have some time in the future I’ll probably make a more custom layout.

After writing this I plan on taking a quick break for dinner and then watching one of the Fundamentals videos hosted by Uncle Bob on https://cleancoders.com/ . After that I’ll either read a chapter of Uncle Bob’s book The Clean Coder or do some more Koans. I haven’t quite decided yet.

I’ll be sure to update y’all tomorrow on how day 2 goes!
