title: "Bowling Kata and Learning"

Today I started off with my Bowling Kata. It took me 45 minutes to get through which is far from my goal
of 10 minutes. The logic isn't very confusing on it, but switching between the test driven development back
and forth has me second guessing every character I type. There are also tons of shortcuts/hotkeys I still 
need to learn. But I guess that really is the point of doing it over and over again.

After our daily stand-up I watched two more Uncle Bob videos. This time they are on the subject of SOLID 
design principles. The principle I learned about this time is the Single Responsibility Principle. 

The Single Responsibility principle is philosophy in Object-Oriented Programming that says a class should 
only be responsible for one piece of functionality. If a class has more than one responsibility those responsibilities
become coupled which causes the program to become fragile (where change to one may unintentionally break the other).
It also makes code easier to understand and maintain when you decouple everything.
I'll be designing a presentation on it to present to my coworkers at next fridays lunch and learn.
