I spent my morning putting some finishing touches on my Single Responsibility Principle presentation followed by
repeating my Bowling Kata over and over again in preparation for today's IPM. My IPM was my first time presenting things
to my clients (my mentors). I have to admit, I was very nervous even though I know they aren't "real" clients. I started
the meeting by showing them that I've gotten 100% on all the tests for the first 14 Uncle Bob training videos. I then
showed them that I had completed the first the Euler Project problems.

Then came the part I was most nervous about. The Bowling Kata. I preformed it probably the fastest I have done yet with 
very minimal fumbling. Both of my mentors were very pleased with the performance! There were a few critiques but nothing 
major. I had a point were a refactored after solving an error, but not solving the test. The TDD method dictates that 
you should only refactor when your test is solved. There was also something in how I named my tests. When naming a test
you should make it so that it reads as a sentence when the test conditions come back passing.

My SRP presentation was what followed. Honestly this is the part I thought I would have no issue with, but when it came
time to present it, I seemed to fumble my words a bit. Apparently I wasn't the only one who noticed because the main
critique I got there was about sounding a little monotone and not excited during the whole thing. It's clear that I
need to work on my "stage performance" a little bit when I do presentations.

After doing all my presentations we moved on to the planning stage for next week. This consists of estimating all the
times I believe the tasks assigned will take me. This part is probably the hardest part of the meeting in my opinion.
There's a couple of tasks I think I was a little ambitious on, but also a few that I think may have been overestimated,
so hopefully it balances out a little bit.
