Today I spent my morning working on Euler 6 and 7. I had actually dedicated more time for these projects than the
previous two, and got these done in half the time as the previous two. I was fully expecting them to be hard and the
others easy, but I guess that is sometimes how things go.

At noon, we had our weekly lunch and learn where I gave my presentation on Single Responsibility Principle. This time
I managed to add some showmanship to it and people seemed to really enjoy it. 

The chapter for our book club this week was on Test Driven Development. It was good to talk about it more with people who
have actual experience with it. While I do have a solid grasp on it now, it isn't quite second nature yet. I catch myself
skipping steps and not always fully following the process the first time, so it is reassuring that it wasn't easy for
anyone originally and that it just comes with time.

The last two things I have to do for this week is to create a video of the Bowling Kata and create a presentation on 
OCP. Both of these items show me being on track with the time I had estimated, but we'll see. I will probably record the
video over the weekend to get that out of the way, but edit it on Monday.
