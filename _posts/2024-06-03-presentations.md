Today didn't have anything very exciting happen. I finished editing the Bowling Kata I had. It took me forever to figure
out how to do the voice-over part of it. It turns out that iMovie really didn't like my headset microphone, so I plugged
in a USB mic my wife owned.

Outside of that I just worked on my Open Closed Principle presentation. I really don't like making slide shows and
presentations, but it does help solidify the information in my brain. I'll grind through and finish knocking it out
tomorrow. Once I'm done with that I can finally go back and refactor a few of the Euler problems I have, which I really
enjoy doing.
