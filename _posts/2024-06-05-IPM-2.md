Today was my second Iteration Planning Meeting. I submitted all the Euler Problems I have done over the last week,
my Bowling Kata video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMY0eEqXkYA), and my presentation on OCP. Everything was 
pretty well received other than the presentation. I received the feedback that the information was all there but
the pacing felt as if I was just checking boxes. I'll definitely have to work on that for my next presentation.

For this upcoming week I have to perform a Kata that converts a number into a roman numeral, a presentation on Liskov 
Substitution Principle, and Euler's 8 - 10. So far today I've only worked on the Roman Numeral Kata, but I have not 
quite figured it out. I'll continue working on it as soon as I wake up tomorrow.
