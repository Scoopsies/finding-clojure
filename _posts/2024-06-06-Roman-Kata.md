Today I spent nearly 7 hours working on the Roman Numeral Kata. This one definitely stumped me more than I'd care to
admit, But I did finally get it running. I then spent another 3 hours debating on best ways to refactor. I'm not sure 
if the method I came up with will be able to be done in less around 10 minutes, but I'll make sure to practice it again
tomorrow. After spending so much time on it I don't even want to think about it again today.

After doing that one I decided to tackle Euler 8. This one did not take me nearly as much time, but refactoring to best
practices definitely took me the longest. I'm sure naming things and making them look readable the first time will come 
naturally with more practice, but for now it is definitely the part of coding that makes me overthink things.
