This week seemed to fly by, but it also seems like I'm not even close to finishing work. On Fridays, we have our lunch
and learns, and book club meetings. It seems like I don't get as much work done as I'd like between those two things.

Today's book club was on the subject of practicing coding. It made a point that outside of work you should work in a
language or stack that you aren't as familiar with a few hours a week. Right now I have not been doing that because I
want to learn Clojure and TDD better, so all of my free time is just handling work. Maybe once I get a little better
with my estimates I can start freeing up some time and contributing to some open source projects in Javascript or Python.

As of now, it seems I'll be practicing my Roman Numeral Kata all weekend, the best time I've gotten so far is 19 minutes,
which is far from the 10-minute target.
