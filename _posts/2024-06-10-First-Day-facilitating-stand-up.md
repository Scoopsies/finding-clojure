title: "My First Time Facilitating Stand-up""

Today was my first day as the mediator for our daily stand-up meeting. It's a pretty straight forward roll. You check
if anyone is missing, decide if it's time to start the meeting, and check for follow-ups at the end. The one thing that
is a little bit special about the way we do ours is the facilitator (mediator, whatever, I'm really not sure the actual
title of the roll) has to pick an overarching subject of the week. With a specific subject to talk about every day. The 
subject can be anything you find interesting or have experience with as far as I can tell. I decided to do mine on 
fermentation. My day one talked about Mesopotamia (where beer was first discovered). I'm not sure what subject I'm doing
tomorrow, but I'll be sure to update you tomorrow on that.

I definitely came to the realization that I have a big fear of public speaking when talking about the subject. I think
that is why my presentations also feel so robotic. I had a giant list of things to talk about with key points, I 
practiced it this morning, and it still felt like I was fumbling through it.

As far as work for the day, I finished my presentation. I just need to practice it more. I also got my Numerals Kata 
down to 11 minutes, so I think it is actually do-able now. I also solved Euler 9. I think this may be the hardest one of 
all I've tried so far now.
