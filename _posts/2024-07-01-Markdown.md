Something I came to the realization of last week is that I don't really know much about Markdown syntax. Its seems kind
of important thing to learn if I'm going to continue to write this blog in Markdown. The few times I decided to make a 
nice readme.md in the past I've used ChatGPT to write it for me, which isn't always the best practice. Especially if I 
want to customize it to my liking without asking the bot a billion questions/revisions.

| Element        | Markdown Syntax                                         |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Heading        | # h1<br/>## h2<br/>### h3                               |  
| Bold           | \*\*bold text**                                         |  
| Italic         | \*italicized test*                                      |  
| Blockquote     | > blockquote                                            |  
| Ordered List   | 1. First item<br/>2. Second Item</br>3.Third Item       |  
| Unordered List | - First Item <br/> - Second Item <br/> - Third Item     |  
| Code           | \`code`                                                 |  
| Horizontal Rule | ---                                                     |
| Link           | \[title]\(https://scoopsies.github.io/finding-clojure/) | 
| Image          | \![alt test]\(image.jpg)                                | 

The majority of these are self explanitory, but I wanted to show a few examples.

### Headings

The word headings above is an h3 heading its self. It makes the text bigger and spaces it. The h2 is larger than h3, and
h1 is the largest.

### Blockquote

> This is block quote. It makes it stand out a bit.

### Code
Code is for individual code snippets. It can `highlight` certain `commands` and or `functions` you want to talk about.

### Horizontal Rule

That gives you a break to split up sections a little bit as seen below.
