title: "Wa-tor Update"

I got a chance to meet with one of the craftsmen who also did Wa-tor as their kata today. They told me that Wa-tor
is too large of an application to do as a kata alone. WHen he did it, he just wrote a program as usual, but chose one
small section (the fish movement) as his kata. I feel a sense of relief now that I'm not crazy or an awful coder,
but also like I've wasted so much time rewriting this code over and over again, so now I don't have the specific section
down to making it a fast presentation. I plan on staying up late to practice that code, but I'm really not sure how 
well it'll play out. I already am at a sleep deficit as is, and it is usually diminishing returns when you code while
tired. 

Sorry for such a short post today, but it seems I have some major catch up to get to.
