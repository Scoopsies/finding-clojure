title: "Another Failed IPM"
date: 2024-07-17

This was my second week not having all my story points done for an IPM. I put in every bit of effort that I have, yet
still fell short. A big majority of it was due to not discovering that Wa-tor was not do-able as a kata, meaning that
I focused too much on the application as a whole instead of just a piece of it I could make into a kata. I probably
should have reached out to the craftsman who had done it sooner.

It's pretty demoralizing to fail two weeks in a row after putting in 65+ hour weeks both weeks, but it is what it is. I
have to make sure to not let it get my down and effect next weeks work. Every week is a new week to learn and succeed.

This week I have to perfect my kata portion of Wa-tor. Finish up my 3-D tic-tac-toe, and do a presentation on version
control systems and why they are important to use frequently. (I got caught not commiting enough).
