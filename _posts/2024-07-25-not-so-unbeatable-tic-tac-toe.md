I spent a majority of my morning today trying to figure out how to implement my mini-max algorithm into 3x3x3
Tic-Tac-Toe. It takes way to long to decide a move with so many options. According to \
[this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iojdLg7eVXc&t=14s) there are 8,401,905,440,137,617,408,000,000
possible games of 3-D tic-tac-toe.
