Today was more of getting my edn working and tied in together. But my ADHD kicked in at a certain point and I decided
to go down a wikipedia rabbit hole, so you're going to learn about what I learned about today! (Don't worry, it's still
coding related.)

### Rich Hickey

Rich Hickey is the creator of the Clojure programming we (or at least I) love so much. He worked on it for only two and
a half years before releasing it in 2007 (I feel like I've had an entire decade of my life where I've achieved less).
Shortly after he also created ClojureScript (a clojure wrapper for JavaScript) and Extensible Data Notation (EDN) data
format. Which is pretty much like a clojure friendly JSON. He worked as the Chief Technology Officer of Cognitect from 
2013 until it was acquired by Nubank in 2020. He remained with Nubank as a Distinguished Engineer until August 2023 when
he announced he'd be retiring from commercial software development.
