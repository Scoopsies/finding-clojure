I recently found myself using atoms for the first time in my clojure code, and figured I'd share the basics.


### What is an atom?

An atom in Clojure is a reference type that allows you to manage shared, synchronous, and independent state. It provides 
a way to store a single value that can be changed atomically, meaning that changes to the value are guaranteed to be 
visible to all threads in a consistent way.

Atoms are useful when you have a value that needs to change over time, and these changes need to be coordinated across 
different parts of your application.

### Creating and using an atom

You can create an atom using the atom function:

```clojure
(def counter (atom 0))
```

Here, counter is an atom holding the value 0. You can access the value of an atom using the @ reader macro or the deref 
function:

```clojure
(println @counter)  ; prints 0
```

### Updating Atoms

To change the value of an atom, you use the swap! or reset! functions.

- **swap!**: This function updates the value of an atom by applying a function to the current value. Itâ€™s useful when 
the new value depends on the old one.
```clojure
(swap! counter inc)
(println @counter)  ; prints 1
```
- **reset!**: This function replaces the current value of the atom with a new value, regardless of the current state.
```clojure
(reset! counter 10)
(println @counter)  ; prints 10
```
