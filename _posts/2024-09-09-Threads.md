Multithreading is an essential aspect of Java programming, enabling the execution of multiple threads concurrently. A 
thread is essentially a lightweight subprocess that operates independently of others, allowing tasks to be run in 
parallel. In this blog post, we’ll dive into Java threads: what they are, how to use them, and why they are beneficial.

### What is a thread?

A thread is a separate path of execution within a program. In a single-threaded application, only one operation occurs 
at a time. However, in a multi-threaded application, multiple threads run simultaneously, which makes it possible to 
perform several operations concurrently.

Java provides built-in support for threads, allowing developers to leverage parallelism easily. The java.lang.Thread 
class is the core of Java’s thread support.

#### Benefits of using threads

1. **Improved Performance**: By running tasks concurrently, applications can take full advantage of multi-core processors
and perform better.
2. **Responsive User Interfaces**: Threads are especially useful in GUI applications, where you can keep the interface 
responsive while performing heavy background operations.
3. **Efficient CPU Usage**: When threads run concurrently, CPU cycles are used more efficiently, as the CPU can switch 
between threads when one is waiting for resources or input/output operations.

#### Thread States
1. **New**: A thread has been created but has not yet started.
2. **Runnable**: The thread is ready to run but waiting for CPU time.
3. **Blocked**: The thread is waiting for a resource.
4. **Waiting**: The thread is waiting indefinitely for another thread to perform a particular action.
5. **Timed** Waiting: The thread is waiting for another thread to perform an action within a specified time.
6. **Terminated**: The thread has completed its execution.

Threads are a powerful tool in Java that enable you to build responsive, high-performance applications by running tasks 
concurrently. Understanding how to create and manage threads, as well as how to synchronize them properly, is key to 
writing efficient multithreaded applications.

Whether you are building a complex server-side application or just want to run background tasks without blocking the 
main program, Java’s thread model provides the flexibility and control needed to do so effectively.
