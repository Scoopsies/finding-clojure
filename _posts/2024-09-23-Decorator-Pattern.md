The Decorator Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows you to add behavior to individual objects without 
affecting other instances of the same class. Think of it as a way to wrap an object in “enhancements” without altering 
its underlying functionality.

### How does it Work?

The decorator pattern involves a base component and one or more decorators that wrap the base component and add
functionality.

- **Component:** The plain interface or object.
- **ConcreteComponent:** A specific implementation of the component.
- **Decorator:** Wraps a component to add extra behavior.

### When should you use it?

The decorator Pattern shines when:

- You want to add responsibilities to individual objects dynamically and transparently.
- Subclassing would create an overload of unnecessary classes.
- You need flexibility and want to combine behaviors at run time.

### Pros and Cons

#### Pros
- **Flexible and Dynamic:** You can mix and match enhancements at runtime.
- **Keeps classes simple:** Instead of making complex classes with many features, you can create decorators that add
features as needed.

#### Cons
- Can become complex with too many layers of decorators.
- Harder to read an debug if overused.
