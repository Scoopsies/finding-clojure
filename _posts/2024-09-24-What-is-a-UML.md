I've recently come to the conclusion that UML diagrams only make sense to me on a basic level. I can see relationships
between classes easily, but I feel like there is a lot of symbolism that is getting lost on me. So that seems like the
perfect opportunity for a blog post, so I can teach as I learn! 

### What is a UML?

UML stands for Unified Modeling Language. It is a standardized visual language used to model and design the structure 
and behavior of systems in software development. It helps architects, developers, and analysts all visualize how
different components of a system work together, making it easier to design, implement, and understand complex systems.

### Key Features of UML:

- **Standardized Notation:** UML provides a universal set of symbols and diagrams to describe different aspects of a system.
- **Visual Representation:** It uses diagrams to represent structures, processes, and interactions within a system,
making abstract ideas easier to understand.
- **Broad Application** While it is mainly used in software development, UML can also model business processes, system
architecture, and other non-software systems.

### Types of UML Diagrams:

UML is categorized into two major types of diagrams.

1. **Structural Diagrams:**
   - Class Diagram: Shows the classes (blueprints) in the system and the relationships between them.
   - Object Diagram: Displays the actual instances of classes at a particular moment.
   - Component Diagram: Visualizes the systemâ€™s components and their relationships.
   - Deployment Diagram: Shows the physical architecture of the system, including hardware and software.
   - Package Diagram: Groups related classes or components into namespaces for organizational clarity.
2. **Behavioral Diagrams:**
   - Use Case Diagram: Illustrates user interactions (use cases) with the system.
   - Sequence Diagram: Depicts the flow of messages between objects in a time sequence.
   - Activity Diagram: Represents the flow of control or operations in a system.
   - State Diagram: Shows the states an object can be in, as well as transitions between those states.

### Why use UML?

- **Communication:** UML provides a clear and standardized way to communicate system designs across teams, helping both
technical and non-technical stakeholders understand the system's blueprint.
- **Planning and Design:** It aids in the early design phase by enabling clear representation of the architecture,
components, and their interactions.
- **Documentation:** UML diagrams serve as documentation for system design, making it easier to maintain, upgrade, and
debug the system over time.
