Clojure’s deftype allows you to define new types that implement Java interfaces or extend Java classes. This can be 
particularly useful when you want to integrate functionality from a Java library in your Clojure code. If you have a 
Java JAR file containing interfaces or abstract classes, you can create Clojure implementations using deftype!

### Why use deftype?

- **Performance**: Types created using deftype compile down to efficient Java bytecode, providing the speed of direct 
Java implementations.
- **Interop**: Clojure’s seamless interop with Java makes it easy to extend Java classes and implement interfaces using 
familiar Clojure syntax.

### Implementing a Java Interface:


Let's assume you have a Java Jar file with an interface Greeting:
```java
public interface Greeting {
    String sayHello(String name);
}
```

To implement this interface in Clojure using deftype, you could write:
```clojure
(ns myapp.greeter
  (:import [com.example Greeting]))

(deftype Greeter []
  Greeting
  (sayHello [this name]
    (str "Hello, " name "!")))
```

Here, deftype creates a new type Greeter that implements the Greeting interface. The sayHello method is overridden with 
Clojure’s concise syntax.

Once you've created the implementation, you can use it as if it were a java object:
```clojure
(let [greeter (Greeter.)]
  (.sayHello greeter "John Connor"))
;; => "Hello, John Connor!"
```

- `deftype` works with Java interfaces and abstract classes.
- It's ideal for cases where performance is critical, as it compiles down to optimized bytecode.
- This approach allows for seamless integration between Clojure and Java libraries.

By leveraging deftype, you can extend existing Java libraries in a more functional, expressive way using Clojure, without
sacrificing performance.
