JAR (Java ARchive) files are a convenient way to package and distribute Java applications, bundling everything your app 
needs—class files, resources, libraries, and metadata—into one compressed file. Think of it as a zipped suitcase for your 
Java project.

### What is a JAR File?

A JAR file is a compressed archive containing:

- Class files
- Resources (images, config files, etc)
- Manifest file (metadata, including the Main-Class for executable JARs)

### Creating a JAR File

1. Compile your Java files:

```
javac com/example/*.java
```

2. Create the JAR:

```
jar cf myapp.jar com/example/*.class
```

3. Add a manifest (for executable JARs):

```
jar cfm myapp.jar MANIFEST.MF com/example/*.class
```

4. Run your JAR:

```
java -jar myapp.jar
```

### Why use JAR files?

- **Convenience**: Everything in one file.
- **Portability**: Works anywhere with a JVM.
- **Modularization**: Break large apps into multiple JARs.
- **Library Distribution**: Many Java libraries are distributed as JAR files.
