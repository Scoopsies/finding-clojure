Imagine borrowing a friend’s car, but instead of a gas pedal, there’s a joystick. You’d probably be confused! The Liskov 
Substitution Principle (LSP) is all about making sure that objects (or functions) can be replaced with their subtypes or 
variations without changing the expected behavior. It’s like swapping one tool for another without changing how you use 
it.

### What is Liskov Substitution Principle?

LSP states "If S is a subtype of T, then objects of type T should be replaceable with objects of type S without altering 
the desirable properties of the program". In simpler terms this means subclasses should be substitutable for their 
base-class. This ensures that substituting one implementation with another won’t break the system, which helps in 
building flexible and maintainable software.

### How does LSP fit with Clojure?

Clojure isn’t object-oriented in the traditional sense, so we don’t have classes or subtypes. Instead, we deal with 
protocols, records, and functions. Applying LSP in Clojure often means making sure that functions, protocols, and data 
types are interchangeable in a way that doesn’t break the logic of your application. The goal is to maintain behavioral 
consistency when swapping out one implementation for another, even if it uses different underlying logic.


### Benefits of Applying LSP

- **Substitutability:** Allows you to change implementations without altering the system’s logic, making refactoring safer.
- **Reduced Surprises**: When different parts of the code behave consistently, it’s easier to predict outcomes, reducing bugs.
- **Enhanced Reusability**: Functions and data types that respect LSP can be used more flexibly in different contexts.



In general functional languages like Clojure don't have classes or inheritance, but still require thoughtful design to 
ensure interchangeable components behave correctly. While LSP in Clojure might look different than an object oriented
example, the core idea of behavioral consistency remains the same.
