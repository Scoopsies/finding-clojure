When working with Git, you’re bound to encounter the question: Should I rebase or merge? Both commands are used to 
integrate changes from one branch into another, but they handle history in very different ways. Let’s break it down.

### Merge: Keeping History Intact

A merge combines the changes from one branch into another by creating a new merge commit. This commit ties the histories 
of the two branches together.

```
git checkout main
git merge feature-branch
```

#### Result:
- The main branch gets a new commit with the changes from feature-branch.
- The history remains complete and chronological, showing exactly when branches diverged and came back together.

#### When to Use Merge:

- You want to preserve the history of how your branches evolved.
- Working in a collaborative team where a full record of branch merges is useful.
- You’re merging a long-lived branch and need a clear timeline.

### Rebase: Rewriting History

Rebase takes the changes from one branch and applies them on top of another branch, effectively rewriting the commit 
history.

```
git checkout feature-branch
git rebase main
```

#### Result:
- The commits from feature-branch are “replayed” onto the latest commit in main.
- History appears linear, as if the feature branch was developed directly from the tip of main.

#### When to Use Rebase:

- You want a clean, linear commit history.
- You’re working solo or rebasing a personal feature branch before merging it.
- You want to avoid cluttering the history with merge commits.

Both rebase and merge are powerful tools in Git. The choice depends on your workflow and priorities: historical accuracy 
versus a clean, streamlined commit history. Understanding these tools ensures your Git history stays as clean—or as 
detailed—as you need it to be.
