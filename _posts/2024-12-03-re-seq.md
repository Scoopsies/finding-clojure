title: "Harnassing the power of regex with re-seq"

This week I started doing [Advent of Code](https://www.adventofcode.com) for the first time ever. I looked at it last year, but
felt intimidated by it, along with being really busy having 5 odd jobs at the time. This year Clean Coders has me pretty
well equipped to tackle the problems and actually have fun doing them, so I've been waking up an hour earlier to get
part 1 knocked out, and doing part 2 before bed every night. I've been really enjoying it because some of the puzzles
force you out of your comfort zone in coding a little bit.

Yesterdays problem required me to get a little more comfortable with regular expressions (regex). While I'm still no 
expert on the subject, it definitely opened taught me quite a bit more than I knew before. While using Clojure, one 
function seemed to help more than ever while using regex, so I figured it's worth a blog post about.

### What is re-seq?

`re-seq` is a function in Clojure that scans a string for matches to a given regular expression and returns them as a 
lazy sequence. Its simplicity and flexibility make it a go-to tool for working with text.

```clojure
(re-seq regex-pattern string)
```

- **regex-pattern**: A regular expression, defined using Clojure’s #" syntax or java.util.regex.Pattern.
- **string**: The input string to search.

The result is a lazy sequence of matches.

### How Does re-seq Work?

When re-seq processes a string, it looks for all substrings that match the given pattern. If the pattern contains 
capturing groups, re-seq returns a sequence of vectors, where the first element is the full match and subsequent 
elements are the contents of the capturing groups.

Examples of re-seq in Action

##### 1. Basic Matching

Let’s start with a simple example: finding all the digits in a string.

```clojure
(re-seq #"\d" "a1b2c3")
;; => ("1" "2" "3")
```

##### 2. Using Capturing Groups

Capturing groups let you extract specific parts of a match. For example, extracting key-value pairs:
```clojure
(re-seq #"(\w+):(\d+)" "name:42 age:30")
;; => (["name:42" "name" "42"] ["age:30" "age" "30"])
```

Here, each match is a vector:
- The first element is the full match ("name:42", "age:30").
- The second and third elements are the contents of the capturing groups ("name" and "42", etc.).

##### 3. Working Without Capturing Groups

If the pattern doesn’t use capturing groups, re-seq returns the full matches as strings.

```clojure
(re-seq #"\w+" "Clojure is fun!")
;; => ("Clojure" "is" "fun")
```

### Tips and Tricks

1.	**Use Capturing Groups Wisely**: If you don’t need capturing groups, avoid them to keep results simpler.
2.	**Combine with Higher-Order Functions**: map, filter, and reduce pair beautifully with re-seq.
3.	**Escape Special Characters**: Regular expressions have special characters (e.g., ., *, +). Escape them with \ when 
needed.
