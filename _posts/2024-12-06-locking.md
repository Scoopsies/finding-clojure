Concurrency is a powerful but tricky beast. When multiple threads access shared resources, you need a way to prevent chaos. 
I recently had an issue where double-clicking a button would process a request twice because the database was not updated
in time to prevent the process from happening a second time. My first thought was to put something to disable the button
from being able to be double-clicked, but after a conversation with my mentor, he brought up the scenario or two different
people on two different machines clicking the button at the same time. Enter `clojure.core/locking`, a built-in tool 
that makes thread synchronization in Clojure easy and elegant.

### What is locking?

The locking macro ensures that only one thread can execute a block of code at a time, protecting shared resources from 
race conditions. It’s like a guard that says, “Wait your turn!”

### How It Works

The syntax for locking is simple:

```clojure
(locking resource
  ;; <your code>
  ...)
```

- **resource**: The object to lock on. Use any object that all threads can reference consistently.
- **Critical** section: Code that modifies shared resources or performs thread-sensitive operations.

### A Simple Example

Let’s create a shared counter and safely increment it using locking:

```clojure
(def counter (atom 0))
(def lock (Object.)) ; Create a lock object

(defn increment-counter []
  (locking lock
    (swap! counter inc)))

; Simulating multiple threads
(doseq [_ (range 10)]
  (future (increment-counter)))

(Thread/sleep 100) ; Wait for threads to finish
(println "Final counter value:" @counter)
```

#### Here’s what happens:
1. A shared lock object ensures only one thread at a time can enter the locking block.
2. The critical section (swap! counter inc) safely increments the counter.

### Why Use locking?

- **Thread Safety**: Prevents simultaneous access to shared resources.
- **Simplicity**: Minimal boilerplate compared to low-level synchronization primitives.
- **Clojure-Friendly**: Plays well with immutable data structures and atoms.
